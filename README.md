# TempAdmin
TempAdmin does just what you think. It creates a temporary admin account, so doing multiple admin tasks just got easier and secure.

Features:
1. Quick. The process takes just 5-10 sec
2. Easy. Just type 2 letters, and admin access is granted
3. Secure. Account auto deletes in 10 minutes (default), and no having to copy your own password to the clipboard, or having to use the very insecure "super Admin" account.
