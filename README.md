# QuickAdmin
QuickAdmin does just what you think. It creates a temporary admin account, so doing multiple admin tasks just got easier and secure.

Features:
1. Quick. The process takes just 5-10 sec
2. Easy. Just type 2 letters, and admin access is granted
3. Secure. Account auto deletes in 10 minutes (default), and no having to copy your own password to the clipboard, or having to use the very insecure "super Admin" account.

How to use:
1. Right click the file, and run as Admin
2. Enter your own password
3. wait until the app says "Press any key to continue." DO NOT press anything, or the new account will be deleted.
4. Do what you have to do, and use the new "QuickAdmin" account for the User Account Control prompt. Use default password "QA", without quotes.
5. After you're done, return back to Command Prompt, and (now) press any key.
6. The window will close automatically. Ignore any errors.
