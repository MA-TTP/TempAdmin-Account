# TempAdmin
TempAdmin does just what you think. It creates a temporary admin account, so doing multiple admin tasks just got easier and secure.

Features:
1. Quick. The process takes just 5-10 sec
2. Easy. Just type 2 letters, and admin access is granted
3. Secure. Account auto deletes in 10 minutes (default), and no having to copy your own password to the clipboard, or having to use the very insecure "super Admin" account.


How to use:
1. Download the latest release
2. Right click the file, and run as admin. You will see SmartScreen pop up.* Click "More info", then in the bottom, click "Run anyway."*
3. Enter your own password in the UAC Prompt.
4. wait until the app says "Press any key to continue." DO NOT press anything, or the new account will be deleted.
5. Do what you have to do, and use the new "TempAdmin" account for the User Account Control prompt. Use default password "TA", which is copied to the clipboard.
6. After you're done, return back to Command Prompt, and (now) press any key.
7. The window will tell you to close it, or it closes automatically.

*SmartScreen always flags bat and cmd files from the internet. You will only see it the first time you run this.
