# QuickAdmin
QuickAdmin does just what you think. It creates a temporary admin account, doing multiple admin tasks just got easier and secure.

How to use:
1. Right click the file, and run as Admin
2. Enter your password
3. wait until the app says "Press any key to continue." DO NOT press anything, or the new account will be deleted.
4. Install your program, and use the new "QuickAdmin" account for the User Account Control prompt. Use default password "QA", without quotes.
5. After the program has installed/has Admin permission, return back to Command Prompt, and (now) press any key.
6. The window will close automatically. Ignore any errors.
